Security is very important for Sketch Converter ðŸ”’

## Versions

The latest version of Musepipe is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to maintainers. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

I (the author, [@samyak-jn](https://github.com/samyak-jn)) will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. ðŸ™Š

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
