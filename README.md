Here's a little something for people like you and me.
This is a simple python script that converts your **captured images** into a **sketch** in real-time with just one line of command, fascinating? üòé

This script is written with the help of the OpenCV library in python.All the sketches will be saved in the parent directory itself.

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/samyak-jn/detect.git
poetry shell
poetry install
sketch_converter --help
```

## Camera Usage

```bash
# video_src = 1 , grayscale mode = 1
sketch_converter video-capture 1 1
```
