# Image to Sketch Converter

Fond of **sketches**, but bad at **art**? ðŸ¥´

Here's a little something for people like you and me.
This is a simple python script that converts your **captured images** into a **sketch** in real-time with just one line of command, fascinating? ðŸ˜Ž

This script is written with the help of the OpenCV library in python.

NOTE: All the sketches will be saved in the parent directory itself.

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/samyak-jn/detect.git
