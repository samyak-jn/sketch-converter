Fond of **sketches**, but bad at **art**? ü•¥

Here's a little something for people like you and me.
This is a simple python script that converts your **captured images** into a **sketch** in real-time with just one line of command, fascinating? üòé

This script is written with the help of the OpenCV library in python.

NOTE: All the sketches will be saved in the parent directory itself.
